  game provide a sequence for round 1
  User tries to match sequence
  game check the correctness of sequence and users sequence


  idea 1 :

  - create a shown array that stores what was shown to user.

  - create a clickedColors array that stores what was clicked by user.

  _ loop through the arrays to compare them to each other.

  - if/else statement to say that if the two arrays are same, go to the next round, but

  - if they are not the same, 'game over'

  What worked in idea1:

  - for one round (sequence of one):  - successfully showed the color to user
                                      - successfully stored user click in userClick array.
                                      - successfully incremented to round = 2;


What didn't work in idea1:

- After user clicks once on first color in the sequence, the play function seems to be looping back to the beginning rather than
waiting for user to finish clicking.
what is needed here: a way to wait untill user clicks the total number of colors in the sequence before the code starts
evalutating anything. possibly: a userclicks var that counts how many times the user clicked. don't run eval function until userclicks
is = to the roundNum.

- the shown array is not clearing so that the first color in sequence duplicates, ex: the array should be ['red', 'blue'...]
instead it's showing ['red', 'red', 'blue']
what is needed: to find the right spot in the code to clear shown array. where should that happen?

- game over is displaying after the player clicks the first time, even if they click correctly.

- function comparing userClicks array to shown array is only comparing the first element, so coming up as true
